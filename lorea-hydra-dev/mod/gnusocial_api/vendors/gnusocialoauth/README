------------

PHP library for working with GNUSocial's OAuth API.

Flow Overview
=============

1. Build GNUSocialOAuth object using client credentials.
2. Request temporary credentials from GNUSocial.
3. Build authorize URL for GNUSocial.
4. Redirect user to authorize URL.
5. User authorizes access and returns from GNUSocial.

7. Get token credentials from GNUSocial.
8. Rebuild GNUSocialOAuth object with client credentials and token credentials.

Terminology
===========

The terminology has changed since 0.1.x to better match the draft-hammer-oauth IETF
RFC. You can read that at http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hammer-oauth. Some of the
terms will differ from those GNUSocial uses as well.

client credentials - Consumer key/secret you get when registering an app with GNUSocial.
temporary credentials - Previously known as the request token.
token credentials - Previously known as the access token.

Parameters
==========

There are a number of parameters you can modify after creating a GNUSocialOAuth object.

Switch an existing GNUSocialOAuth install for another API.

    $connection->$host = "https://yourgnusocial.com/api/";

Custom useragent.

    $connection->useragent = 'Custom useragent string';

Verify GNUSocials SSL certificate.

    $connection->ssl_verifypeer = TRUE;
